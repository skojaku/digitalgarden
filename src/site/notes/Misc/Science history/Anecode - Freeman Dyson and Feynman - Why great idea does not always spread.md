## Why a great idea did not  spread

updated: 2023-03-20

A genius idea does not alone spread to many. An idea spreads through *people* who appreciate the idea. 

Richard Feynman introduced the Feynman diagram, which had revolutionalized theoretical physics. However,  when Feynman presented the diagram at the Pocono conference for the first time, no one followed, and thus no development afterward. 

The idea spread thanks to Freeman Dyson, a graduate student at that time. Being friends with Feynman at Cornel, Dyson had ample opportunities to learn about the diagram, together with  Julian Schwinger's approach presented at the Pocono conference. Dyson found that these two approaches are mathematically equivalent. He wrote

> Feynman and Schwinger talk in such completely different languages that neither of them is able to understand properly what the other is doing

Worse still, no one else could understand what either of them was doing since they did not provide a moderately intelligent account. So Dyson published two papers that serve as "how-to" guide, providing step-by-step rules for drawing Feynman's new diagram together with its mathematical elements, which was what the audience at the Pocoro conference was probably looking for.

Not only Dyson makes the Feynman diagram more accessible and understandable, but also he spread the idea through training scientists. Dyson moved to Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where he worked together with many postdocs. A fellow postdoc, Norman Kroll, put

> I had never understood anything I had heared Feynman say. (However), I understood what Dyson did very well.

Although Dyson initially faced strong push back from Oppenheimer, they finally worked together to turn the Institute into a factory of Feynman diagram. Very quickly, as the postdoc cycled through the Institute, they established a pedagogical cascade. They learned and practiced the diagrammatic techniques during their brief postdoctral study, then fanned out across country. The Feynman diagram, thus, spreads all over the US and beyond, becoming a fundamental tool in theoretical physics. 

Although Dyson was not the original inventor of the Feynman diagram, his contribution to making it accessible and understandable is substantial. This anecode is a great example that underlines the importance of effective communications, and that a great idea alone does not disseminate itself to many; it is spread through people.
