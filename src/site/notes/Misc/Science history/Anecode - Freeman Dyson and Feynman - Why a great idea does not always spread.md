## Why a great idea does not always spread

updated: 2023-03-20

When Richard Feynman first introduced his revolutionary Feynman diagram in theoretical physics, it was met with confusion at the Pocono conference. This was partly because Feynman spoke a mathematical language that could not be understood by physicist at that time. Worse still, Feynman did not publish anything about his invention. The Feynman diagram was nearly faded away. 

However, the Feynman diagram revived and even was florished thanks to Freeman Dyson, a graduate student at the time and a friend of Feynman's at Cornell. Dyson published two papers that provided step-by-step rules for drawing the diagram and its mathematical elements, making it more accessible and understandable for others.

Dyson's contribution did not stop there. As a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, Dyson, togehter with Oppenheimer, created a *"postdoc cascade"*, in which they trained many postdoc to master the diagrammatic techniques during their brief postdoctoral studies and then spread the knowledge to others as they fanned out across the country. This network created by Dyson allowed the Feynman diagram to become a fundamental tool in theoretical physics.

While Feynman was the original inventor of the diagram, it may have faded into obscurity without Dyson's efforts to make it accessible and understandable and spread it through the network he created. Dyson's role in linking people and ideas allowed the Feynman diagram to flourish and become an important part of theoretical physics.
