# The first round of interviews 

## What to expect

At job interviews, you are expected to demonstrate how you would be a good fit for the department. What can you bring to the department? How do you fit into the department's research, teaching, services, and mission? What research and teaching can you do in the department?

## Think from an  interviewer's perspective ðŸ‘€

Interviewers are not also human beings with bones and skins. Understanding how they feel at the interview provides some insight into what to do during the interviews.

First, for many faculties, being on the side of interviewers is a first-time experience. This means that they also learn how to interview interviewees during interviews. They formulate questions more concisely and critically during the course of the search. Each interviewer is responsible for a section of questions. For instance, one person is responsible for research-related questions, another for teaching-related questions, and so on. So if you see a kind of switch, it's a sign that the previous question is over. 

Second, dozens of interviews are packed into several days, and interviewers become exhausted towards the end. Each interview takes more or less a half hour. But the interval to the following interview is short, like five or ten minutes. During this "break," interviewers must formulate their opinions and prepare for the next interview. 

Third, interviewers may not entirely focus on interviews. Some may think about football, shopping, or school to send their kids to.  During your interviews, someone thinks about how they are evaluated by others within the search committee ðŸ‘€.

Given the mental state of interviewers, 
- Do not assume that they study you before the interviews. You have to present who you are, what you do, and for what purpose in a concise, coherent, and memorable way. 
- Prepare concise and clear descriptions of your research, teaching, and service of the present and future. During the interview, try identifying which description fits better to the question or routing the question to the answer you prepared.
