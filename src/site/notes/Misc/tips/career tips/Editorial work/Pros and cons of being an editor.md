# Pros and cons of being an editor
updated: 2022-10-26


Being editor is a good opportunity to make a social network of people and get recognision in your field. Your name will be associated with topics, and people will know you as a specialist. However, editorial work can be time consuming. Assembling editorial board, advertizing the journal, finding reviewers, supervising review process, making final decisions. It is slow time consuming-process, and can take forever. I'm told from a senior editor that it usually takes 2-3 hours per week for a couple of months. That's the amount of time the *senior* editor spent for editorial work.
