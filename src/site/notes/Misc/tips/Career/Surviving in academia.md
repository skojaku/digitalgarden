# Surviving in academia
updated: 2022-09-26


## Feeling stupid
You may feel unconfortable and stupid during Ph.D. But that's a good sign:)
[The importance of stupidity in scientific research | Journal of Cell Science | The Company of Biologists](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/121/11/1771/30038/The-importance-of-stupidity-in-scientific-research)

> "Science involves confronting our 'absolute stupidity'. That kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown."

> The point of the exam isn't to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it's the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student's weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student's knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project.
