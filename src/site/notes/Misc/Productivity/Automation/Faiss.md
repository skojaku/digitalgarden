# Faiss
updated: 2022-10-13


Faiss is a library for finding the nearest t neighbors in a high-dimensional space powered by GPUs and unreasonably fast, thanks to intelligent indexing and data structure. Faiss is flexible but sometimes verbose to do a simple thing. 

Configuring faiss is surprisingly tricky, especially when using smart approximation and GPUs. So, I wrote a helper function that makes the configuration easier:
