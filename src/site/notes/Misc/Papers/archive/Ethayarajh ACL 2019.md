- There is a lack of understanding about how to measure and remove biases from word embeddings
- A method called subspace projection can be used to debias word embeddings and is equivalent to training on an unbiased corpus under certain conditions.
-  he most commonly used association test for word embeddings, WEAT, overestimates bias
- A new measure of an association called the relational inner product association (RIPA) has been developed using subspace projection.
- Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS) does not generally make words more gendered than they are in the training corpus, but it can amplify the gender association for stereotyped words.
