# Summary

This research shows that even word embeddings trained on large datasets, such as Google News articles, can exhibit gender stereotypes. The paper presents a methodology for modifying word embeddings to remove gender stereotypes while still maintaining their useful properties and desired associations. This can be used to prevent the amplification of gender bias in applications that use word embeddings.
