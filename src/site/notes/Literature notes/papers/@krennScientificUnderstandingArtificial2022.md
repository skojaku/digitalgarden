## Background
AI has been called a revolutionary tool in scientific research and is expected to play a creative role in advancing various fields. Can AI contribute to fundamental scientific understanding?

This paper argues that AI can bring new scientific understanding beyond simple numerics. There are three dimensions that AI can contribute for:
1. AI is a powerful *instrument* that enables us to see the world that is otherwise invisible with the naked eye.
2. AIs generate *a source of inspiration* for new concepts and ideas that are subsequently understood and generalized by humans.
3. AIs become agents of understanding and can transfer it to human researchers. 

## What is *scientific understanding*?

See [[Research-note/Science of Science/Scientific Understanding\|Scientific understanding]]

## Gaining scientific understanding with AIs 

Scientists are working at the interface between AI and the natural sciences, trying to rediscover physical laws or concepts with machines:

- [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 010508 (2020) - Discovering Physical Concepts with Neural Networks](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.010508)
- [Machine learning the thermodynamic arrow of time | Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-1018-2)
- [AI Feynman: A physics-inspired method for symbolic regression | Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aay2631)

Although the machines successfully rediscover some physical laws, it remains unclear whether AIs can contribute to new scientific understanding. We direct AIs to rediscover established scientific understanding implicitly and explicitly in its objective and data. It remains still unclear whether machines generate new scientific discoveries that are digestible for humans as scientific understanding. 

## Three dimensions of AI-assisted understanding 

### Computational microscope
A microscope enables us to understand objects that are otherwise invisible to us. Computational microscope enables the investigation of objects or processes that cannot be visualized or probed in any other way, i.e., biological, chemical, or physical processes that happen at length and time scales not accessible in experiments. 

The computationa microscope has evolved in two directions, namely increasing complexity and accuracy driven by the increasing power of computation and advances in data representation. 

In particular, data representation is the key to enabling humans to grasp the underlying structures and facilitate new scientific understanding. 


### Resource of inspiration 
Surprise and creative ideas are the foundation of scientific advances. AIs have already provided many surprises, some of which are subsequently generalized into scientific understanding by humans.

I also like the surprise of Barabasi and Huawei by the algorithm for credit allocation (page 199):

AIs can be used to find surprising and overlooked knowledge in the scientific literature. This is particularly useful, given the sheer volume of scientific papers that make it possible for single individuals to grasp a wide range of scientific discoveries.

One can obtain surprising concepts by inspecting models.
