**Background and limitation** A plethona of disambiguation algorithms have been proposed. Yet, there is a lack of a unified benchmark that allows us the comparison of different algorithms. 

**Results**
- Provided a unified format for name disambiguation benchmark datasets, with meta data supplemented by Semantic Scholar. 
- Provided a new open-sourced reference AND algorithm implementation 
- By training the algorithms across different datasets, SAND prevents overfitting to a single dataset and improves the overall performance of algorithms across different datasets.
