## Quiz 1

```python
array = [{}] * 3

for i in range(3):
	array[i][f"{i}"] = i
	
print(array)
```

Opartor `*`  is useful to specify the size of list and filled with a value. But this operaor creates a `view` if the element is mutable, like `dict` and `list`. This means that `array[0]` and `array[1]` are pointers referencing the same object, so that manipulating `array[0]` changes  `array[1]`.
