## Bloomington Indiana USA
My first move to Bloominton was Feburary 2020, which is just before the pandemic hit the US. We rent a town house in [Covernanter Hil](https://www.covenanterhill.com/) ! But, after two years, we were haunted by the unprecedented inflation, pushing me a quest of finding cheaper place to stay. Soon after I searched the house market, I found a relatively cheep house. Later, however, the house wasn't ready for rent at the time I rent, and I had no choice but to break the lease. I am sincerely here to share with you my experience and hope you to find a good place to have a happy life in Bloomington. Be aware that my view is biased and a sample of $n=1$.
 
### Where to stay?
Let me divide Bloomington into five districts, downtown, North, South, East and West. Probably the most secure and quite district is South, followed by East, North, West, and downtown. 

- **South**: Near the Olecott park and South High School 
	- South is the most secure and quite place to live in Bloominton. It's a nice district in particular if you have kids because there are several elementary schools. However, South may not be a good option if you don't have a car. There are few buses connecting the city center and South, and no sparmarket is not within a walking distance for most part of South district. 
- **East**: Near the Collage mall Kroger
	- If you don't have a car but want to live in a quite environment, I think East is the best option. There are many buses to the university. There are many shops and supermaket within walking distance. It's convenient and relatively quite, although the rent is a bit pricy. 
- **North**: Around Cascade road
	- If you want to save money but still want to maintain the accessibility to the university, I think North is a good option. There are many apartments and some convinience stores near the studiam. Although I've never considered this area as an option, if I were a student, I would take it into consideration. One potential issue could be noise as it is close to stadium. 
- **West**: Around the Wallmart
	- I've never lived in West district but according to the crime map, West may not be a good place to live (maybe I'm wrong).

### How to find apartment/house
Most houses and apartments for rent can be found in the following websites. 
- [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/)
- [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/)

### Don't buy a house, buy neighborhood
This is a Russina proverb saying the importance of neighborhood. You can see the neighborhood in Google Map. But I strongly recommend to actually go there and walk. You can see how clearn the neighborhood is and how friendy people are. Furthermore, you can get a better sense of your future life. Here are my non-exlusive list of good neighborhood. 
- Clearn
- People are friendry, welcoming, and inclusive 
- Well-maintained houses 
- No broken cars and burned houses

### Know your landlord
Landlord is often overlooked but an important factor when it comes to renting. A good landlord is responsive and responsible. And your quality of stay largely hinges on landlord. 

I made a big mistake in finding a good landlord. In 2022, we decided to move within Bloominton, and found a relatively cheap house on Feburary. We made a contract with the landlord for a lease starting from August. After a half year, I moved in the house. But the house wasn't ready for rent. The carpet was full of dog hairs and windows were broken. The lights were about fallen off. The house was full of odd smells. Actually, the landlord admitted that the carpet wasn't clearned although the landlord promised to clearn it *professionally* (professionally means nothing, by the way). The landlord wasn't responsible. No reply to our email, and phone was no luck too. Every communication is one direction from the landlord to us about how to pay rent. In many aspects, the landlord undervalued our safety and quality of life.

I have so many things to write here to emphasize the single point. Know your landlord before making contract. Talk to landlord about the house to check they care about you and the house. Send emails or text to see if the landlord is responsive.
