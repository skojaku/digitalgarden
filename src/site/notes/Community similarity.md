- Variation of Information: 
	- Variation of Information is a distance metric.
	- [Comparing Clusterings by the Variation of Information | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45167-9_14)
	- [Are Mutual Information and Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence equivalent? - Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/487012/are-mutual-information-and-kullback-leibler-divergence-equivalent)
- Normalized mutual information
	- Has a information-theoretic interpretation of the metric
- Element-centric similarity:
	- Fixes the implicit biases of the prevailing similarity metrics. 
	- It can be extended to non-exclusive community structures such as hierarchical and overlapping communities. Highly Recommended.
