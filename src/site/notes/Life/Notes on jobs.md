# The first round of interviews 

## Think of yourself from an  interviewer's perspective

Interviewers are also human beings with bones and skins. Understanding how they feel at the interview is critical to prepare for interviews.

First, for many faculties, being on the side of interviewers is a first-time experience. This means that they also learn how to interview interviewees during interviews. They formulate questions more concisely and critically during the course of the search. Each interviewer is responsible for a section of questions. For instance, one person is responsible for research-related questions, another for teaching-related questions, and so on. So if you see a kind of switch, it's a sign that the previous question is over. 

Second, dozens of interviews are packed into several days, and interviewers become exhausted towards the end. Each interview takes more or less a half hour. But the interval to the following interview is short, like five or ten minutes. During this "break," interviewers must formulate their opinions and prepare for the next interview. 

Third, interviewers may not entirely focus on interviews. Some may think about football, shopping, or school to send their kids to.  During your interviews, someone thinks about how they are evaluated by others within the search committee, for example, junior faculty.

## What to do?

Interviewers may not focus on interviews because of a tight schedule, stress, or other more important stuff they have during the interviews. Now, your goal is to make you memorable to the exhausting interviewers. 

- Do not assume that they study you before the interviews. You have to present who you are, what you do, and for what purpose, in a concise, coherent, and memorable way. 
- Prepare concise and clear descriptions of your research, teaching, and service of the present and future. During the interview, try identifying which description fits better to the question or routing the question to the answer you prepared. 
- Link your story to them. Research the interviewers' backgrounds.
