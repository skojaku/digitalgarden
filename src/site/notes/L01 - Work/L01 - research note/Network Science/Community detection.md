## Graph cut 

Graph cut is a problem of finding a minimal set of edges whose removal breaks a connected component into multiple disconnected components. Finding such a minimal edge set is often an NP-hard combinatorial problem. However, it is possible to find a fairly good cut by relaxing the discrete combinatorial problem into a spectral decomposition problem.

## Modularity 

Modularity introduces the idea that communities must be denser than *random* connections (i.e. a null model). The introduction of null models is a major departure from graph cuts, which may find communities sparser than random connections.

We can introduce domain knowledge about random connections. For instance, if a network is a railroad network, the random network must be a planner graph with no edges crossing. There are many variants of modularity combined with different null models:
