# Preferential attachment model

Preferential attachment is a universal and fundamental mechanism underlying the growth of networks. It manifestes a *rich-gets-richer* phenomenon and yields heavy-tailed distributions. 


# How it works

In a  preferential attachment model, a new node (say $i$) initially has $m_i$ free arms and provides each arm to an existing node (say $j$) with probability proportional to the number of citations $c_t(j)$ that node $j$ has at that time. A network is generated by repeating this process. 

## Initial attractiveness
Because every node has no citation when it appears, the probability of the first citation is zero, which breaks the model. A common workaround is to give some fixed number of citations (say c_0) to new papers as a kind of “log-in bonus”, which is called *initial attractiveness*. Then,  the probability of getting one free arm from a new node is $c_t(j)+c_0$, where ct is the number of accumulated citations at time t. A common choice c_0 = 1.

## Recency
Recency is a natural consequence of the exponential growth. It appers even for a pure preferential attachment model.
