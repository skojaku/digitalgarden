# Network diagram 

Probably the first network diagram was presented in a work by [Jacob Moreno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_L._Moreno) for group therapy. 

- [The Application of the Group Method to the Classification of Prisoners on JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2785020?origin=crossref)

The central idea of group therapy (or group psychotherapy) is to treat a social group as a group and treat individuals in the context of a group setting, not a collection of individuals. Moreno believed that, in order to realize effective intervention for group therapy, one must have good assessment tools for the group, and he invented sociogram.

# Random networks 

Moreno and Jenning invented random graphs as a way to assess the significance of the network structure. 

- [JL Moreno, HH Jennings, 1938. Statistics of social configurations. _Sociometry_, 1(3/4):342–374.](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2785588)

...in which they consider a random graph, where a node has the same number of directed edges emanating from them that are connected to other nodes uniformly at random. Their papers used the random model to define the structure, where an edge represents the tendency of social ties to be reciprocated.
