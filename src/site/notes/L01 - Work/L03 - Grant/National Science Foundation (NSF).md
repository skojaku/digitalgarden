# National Science Foundation (NSF)
updated: 2022-12-22

## Structure 

NSF is divided into seven *directories* focusing on science and engineering:
- Biological Science
- Computer and Information Science and Engineering
- Engineering, Geosciences
- Mathematical and Physical Sciences
- Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences
- Education and Human Resources. 

Each directory is headed by an assistant director. Each directory is divided into *divisions*. Each division manages a portfolio of proposal grants.

## Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)

CISE has four divisions
-   [Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC)
-   [Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF)](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=CCF)
-   [Computer and Network Systems (CNS)](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=CNS)
-   [Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS)](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IIS)

Each division is divided into *core programs* focusing on specific research areas (not confident, though ðŸ™‚). As of 2022-12-22, the core programs are 

- Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF):
	-   Algorithmic Foundations (AF) program;
	-   Communications and Information Foundations (CIF) program;
	-   Foundations of Emerging Technologies (FET) program; and
	-   Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) program.
- Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS):
	-  Computer Systems Research (CSR) program; and
	-  Networking Technology and Systems (NeTS) program.
- Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS):
	-   Human-Centered Computing (HCC) program;
	-   Information Integration and Informatics (III) program; and
	-   Robust Intelligence (RI) program.
- Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC):
	-  OAC Core Research (OAC Core) program

Each division has additional funding programs. For example, the IIS division has [a program focusing on fairness in AI](https://beta.nsf.gov/programid/505651?org=CISE&from=home).
